Coding Instructor AI
---------------------
A web-based AI-powered coding assistant designed to help developers and students with programming questions in real-time. Built using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Gemini API, the application provides detailed explanations, code examples, and debugging guidance across multiple programming languages. Key features include:

1.Interactive Q&A for programming concepts, algorithms, and language-specific questions.

2.Real-time AI responses with formatted code snippets and explanations.

3.Dashboard displaying coding statistics, popular topics, and progress tracking.

4.Responsive, dark-mode user interface with intuitive sidebar navigation.

5.Error handling and loading indicators for seamless user experience.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in Generative AI integration, LLM-based coding assistance, and building user-friendly AI interfaces.
